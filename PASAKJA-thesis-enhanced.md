## CHAPTER 1

## INTRODUCTION

Transportation plays an important role in our community by helping people move to their destination safely and quickly. As technology improves, transportation services have become more modern and convenient. However, many communities in the Philippines, especially in local areas like ours, still face problems such as difficulty in finding rides — wasting time while waiting, missing trips, unclear fare prices, and a lack of security. Drivers also experience challenges in looking for passengers, monitoring their income, uneven earnings, and a lack of organized dispatching.

Adekola et al. (2021) studied how road transport ticket booking can be moved from manual, counter-based systems to an online platform. Traditionally, passengers had to book tickets in person at transport terminals, which caused long wait times and other problems. The researchers proposed a web-based booking system that lets travelers and transport employees buy and sell tickets online, improving convenience and reducing delays. They also discussed challenges users and administrators face and suggested ways to successfully build and use the system. The system was developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a MySQL database. This online booking portal could support future improvements, such as better connections between transport users and companies.

Moreover, Dexter (2025) studied how local systems and services can be improved through technology-based solutions, focusing on student-led capstone projects that address practical problems in communities. Traditionally, many operations relied on manual processes, paper records, and in-person interactions, which caused inefficiencies and delays. The researcher proposed various digital solutions, including web-based management systems, mobile applications, and automation tools, to improve accessibility, operational efficiency, and user experience. The study also highlighted common challenges in system development, such as user adoption, interface design, and technical limitations, and suggested strategies for successful implementation to create functional and interactive platforms supporting future improvements in education, transportation, and community services.

In response to these needs, this study proposes "Pasakja: A Web-based Community Transportation Booking & Dispatching System." The system is designed to connect passengers, drivers, and administrators through a centralized web platform that simplifies ride booking, dispatching, monitoring, and management within the community. It provides a simple and reliable way for passengers to book rides using their devices. At the same time, it gives drivers an organized system for receiving bookings and navigating to their destinations. It uses modern technology such as GPS, real-time tracking, and online payment options to improve the whole riding experience.

## CHAPTER 2

## REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE / SYSTEMS

This chapter reviews existing literature and studies related to the development of Pasakja: A Web-based Community Transportation Booking & Dispatching System. It focuses on previous works and technologies involving web-based transportation systems, ride booking platforms, dispatching methods, GPS tracking, fare calculation, and online payment services. The purpose of this review is to identify useful ideas, features, and challenges from existing systems that can help guide the design of the proposed system. It also provides a foundation for understanding how the proposed system improves or differs from existing transportation solutions and supports the objectives of this study.

Ulay, D. A. L. L., Domingo, A. D. D., Beran, C. J. A., Lazarte, A. L. S., et al. (2025) developed and evaluated an internet-based mobile application designed to improve tricycle reservation systems in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro. The study explained how the system enables passengers to register, view available tricycles, and confirm bookings through a mobile interface. The findings revealed that the application reduces waiting time, improves communication between drivers and passengers, and minimizes inefficiencies associated with traditional manual booking methods. The researchers also emphasized that the app enhances operational efficiency by providing real-time updates and automated booking records.

This study supports the implementation of Pasakja, as the system provides a digital platform that allows users to conveniently book tricycle rides anytime and anywhere. By improving accessibility and user experience, Pasakja modernizes local transport service delivery while addressing the limitations of conventional booking practices.

Pizarro, Gumabay, and Gumarang (2025) developed and evaluated the TC-TRISSEA mobile application, designed to enhance the safety, satisfaction, and service quality of tricycle commuters in Tuguegarao City. The study explained that the app allows passengers to access driver profiles, track rides in real time, and provide feedback through a mobile interface. The findings revealed that the application significantly improved commuter safety, ensured proper fare payments, and promoted accountability among drivers. IT experts also rated the app as highly compliant with ISO 25010 software quality standards, confirming its usability and reliability.

This study demonstrates how mobile applications can improve local transport systems by addressing inefficiencies, enhancing user experience, and increasing commuter confidence in tricycle services — making it directly relevant to Pasakja.

Joyride Group, Inc. (2022) developed Joyride, a Philippine-based ride-hailing platform designed to modernize last-mile transportation by enabling passengers to book motorcycle taxis and tricycles through a mobile application. The system integrates real-time GPS tracking, automated fare computation, cashless payment through GCash and other digital wallets, and a driver verification process that requires background checks and vehicle registration prior to onboarding. Joyride serves passengers in Metro Manila and key provincial areas, offering a safe and organized alternative to the conventional practice of flagging down tricycles and motorcycles on the street. The platform also provides trip history records, mutual driver and passenger rating systems, and in-app customer support to enhance service accountability and user confidence.

This system is highly relevant to Pasakja as both platforms aim to modernize community-level transport services in the Philippine context. Pasakja draws from Joyride's approach to driver verification, cashless payment integration, real-time GPS tracking, and user rating systems. However, Pasakja extends these features by targeting community transport operators with a centralized web-based dispatching and booking management interface, allowing administrators to monitor and manage multiple transport operations simultaneously — a capability that consumer-oriented applications like Joyride do not offer.

Angkas, Inc. (2023) operates Angkas, a motorcycle taxi booking platform that became one of the first Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applications to be officially regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in the Philippines. The platform allows passengers to book motorcycle taxi rides through a mobile application, with features including real-time driver tracking via GPS, automated fare calculation based on distance, mandatory helmet provisioning, and a two-way rating system for drivers and passengers. Angkas implements driver accreditation through background checks, driving skills assessments, and mandatory safety briefings to ensure service quality and passenger protection. The platform's booking interface provides passengers with estimated fares, driver information, and trip monitoring functionality both before and during the ride, contributing to a transparent and accountable service experience.

This system is relevant to Pasakja as it demonstrates the critical role of driver accountability systems, transparent fare structures, and GPS-based real-time tracking in building a reliable and trustworthy community transportation platform. Pasakja incorporates similar mechanisms for driver management and fare estimation while extending the system to accommodate multiple vehicle types — including tricycles, motorcycles, and vans — and providing a web-based administrative interface for centralized community transportation operations management.

Grab Holdings Inc. (2023) operates Grab, one of Southeast Asia's largest and most comprehensive super applications, offering transportation services across eight countries including the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar. The Grab transport platform provides GrabCar, GrabBike, GrabTrike, and other vehicle-type-specific booking services through an intelligent algorithm-driven dispatching system that automatically matches passengers with nearby available drivers based on proximity, vehicle type, and estimated time of arrival. Key platform features include real-time GPS navigation, upfront fare estimation, multiple payment options encompassing both cash and GrabPay, safety tools such as an emergency SOS button and trip-sharing functionality, and a dual rating system for both drivers and passengers to sustain service quality across all transactions. Grab processes millions of transportation bookings daily across Southeast Asia, making it one of the most widely adopted digital transportation platforms in the region.

This system is directly relevant to Pasakja as it illustrates the scalable design of a multi-modal, GPS-driven, and algorithmically dispatched transportation booking platform. Pasakja adopts core concepts from Grab's platform — including real-time GPS tracking, automated driver-passenger matching, fare estimation, and emergency SOS alert features — and adapts them to serve community-level transport needs. Unlike Grab, which operates at a large commercial scale across multiple countries, Pasakja focuses specifically on community transport management and provides administrators with direct oversight of drivers, bookings, and transport operations within a defined service area.

Cramer and Krueger (2016) studied the disruptive impact of Uber's digital platform on the traditional taxi industry, focusing on how algorithmic driver-passenger matching, transparent fare pricing, and GPS navigation transformed the ride-hailing service model. The study found that Uber drivers achieved significantly higher vehicle utilization rates compared to conventional taxi drivers, attributed to the platform's efficient digital dispatching system that eliminates the need for manual radio dispatch or physical queuing at taxi stands. The researchers further noted that Uber's standardized passenger and driver rating system promotes accountability and encourages consistent service quality, while the real-time GPS tracking feature provides both transparency and safety assurance for passengers. Cramer and Krueger concluded that Uber's success demonstrated how data-driven platforms can address long-standing inefficiencies in transportation services that manual and radio-dispatch systems had failed to resolve for decades.

These findings provide foundational context for the design of Pasakja. The core platform principles established by Uber — automated dispatching, upfront fare computation, real-time GPS tracking, and a mutual accountability rating system — have since been adapted by numerous localized transportation applications, including Grab, Joyride, and Angkas in Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Pasakja applies these same evidence-based principles within a community transport setting, demonstrating how proven global ride-hailing innovations can be adapted to address the unique transportation needs and operational requirements of local communities.

Iliopoulou and Kepaptsoglou (2019) presented a comprehensive review of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and their application in public transportation management. The study explained that Transportation Management Systems (TMS) utilize information and communication technologies to support vehicle assignment, route planning, scheduling, and operational control. According to the authors, the integration of optimization techniques and real-time data improves decision-making in transport operations and enhances the overall efficiency of transportation services. The study further emphasized that organized transport management reduces congestion, minimizes service delays, and improves passenger satisfaction.

This literature is relevant to the Pasakja system because it applies similar ITS principles to manage different community transport modes such as tricycles, motorcycles, and vans. By systematically assigning vehicles to passengers and monitoring transport operations, Pasakja ensures timely service delivery and effective utilization of transport resources within the community.

Adekola et al. (2021) developed and evaluated a web-based online road transport booking system designed to replace traditional manual booking processes. The study described how the system allows passengers to register, select transport services, and confirm bookings through an online interface. The findings revealed that online booking systems significantly reduce passenger waiting time and eliminate the need for physical presence at booking stations. The researchers also highlighted that such systems improve operational efficiency by automating record-keeping and reducing human errors.

This study supports the implementation of Pasakja, as the system similarly provides a web-based platform that enables passengers to conveniently book community transport services. By allowing users to make reservations anytime and anywhere, Pasakja enhances accessibility, improves user experience, and modernizes local transport service delivery.

AbdelAziz et al. (2019) examined the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology in transportation systems to improve vehicle tracking and travel time estimation. The study explained that GPS-based tracking enables real-time monitoring of vehicle movement, which helps transport operators manage fleets more effectively. It also allows passengers to receive accurate information regarding vehicle location and estimated arrival time. The researchers emphasized that GPS integration improves route planning, reduces uncertainty in travel, and enhances transparency in transport services.

These findings are directly applicable to Pasakja, as the system incorporates GPS technology to track the real-time location of assigned vehicles. This feature allows passengers to monitor their rides while enabling drivers to navigate efficiently to pickup and drop-off locations. As a result, GPS integration in Pasakja improves reliability, safety, and overall service quality.

Estrada-Esquivel et al. (2022) discussed the development of a smart web-based information system for urban transportation using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The study highlighted that web-based platforms provide continuous system access, real-time information updates, and improved interaction between passengers and transport operators. The authors noted that such systems enhance communication, reduce information gaps, and support better decision-making for both users and administrators.

This study is relevant to Pasakja because the system is developed as a web-based information platform that connects passengers, drivers, and administrators. Through this platform, users can perform bookings, view trip information, monitor vehicle status, and manage transport operations efficiently. The web-based nature of Pasakja ensures accessibility regardless of time and location.

Barrera Hernandez et al. (2025) investigated adaptive dispatching and scheduling systems in public transportation. The study explained that intelligent dispatching mechanisms use real-time data, passenger demand, and vehicle availability to optimize vehicle allocation. The results showed that adaptive dispatching reduces service delays, improves response time, and enhances operational efficiency. The authors concluded that smart scheduling systems are essential for modern transport services, especially in areas with fluctuating demand.

This literature supports the design of Pasakja's dispatching and scheduling feature. By automatically matching nearby drivers to passenger requests and generating efficient schedules, Pasakja ensures timely and reliable community transport services. The application of adaptive dispatching principles improves service quality and maximizes the utilization of available transport resources.

### Synthesis

The compilation of literature and studies presented in this chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of how technology transforms community transportation systems. The synthesis of these studies highlights a common theme: the integration of web-based platforms, GPS tracking, intelligent dispatching, and real-time information significantly enhances operational efficiency, service reliability, and user convenience. Across the reviewed research, it is evident that technology enables systematic vehicle management, streamlines booking processes, improves route planning, and facilitates seamless interaction between passengers, drivers, and administrators. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of adopting technological solutions to create an accessible, efficient, and user-centered community transportation system, as exemplified by the design and development of Pasakja.

The reviewed literature shows that digital and intelligent technologies are increasingly being used to improve community and public transportation. Traditional manual transport processes often result in long waiting times, poor coordination, and limited access to services, while web-based and mobile-based systems offer faster, more organized, and more user-friendly transportation solutions. Local studies by Ulay et al. (2025) and Pizarro, Gumabay, and Gumarang (2025) show that digital reservation and monitoring systems for tricycles improve passenger convenience, safety, and communication between drivers and commuters. These studies confirm that features such as online booking, vehicle tracking, and access to driver information help increase passenger trust and satisfaction while reducing inefficiencies in local transport services. These findings support Pasakja's goal of modernizing community transportation through a web-based platform.

Philippine-based commercial platforms further support these results. Joyride Group, Inc. (2022) and Angkas, Inc. (2023) demonstrate that locally-contextualized ride-hailing platforms with GPS tracking, cashless payments, and driver verification can be successfully adopted in Philippine communities. Grab Holdings Inc. (2023) provides an even larger-scale example of multi-modal, algorithmically-dispatched transportation, with features such as SOS alerts and dual rating systems. These platforms validate the feature set implemented in Pasakja and confirm the relevance of such capabilities for community-level transport services.

International studies provide additional foundational support. Cramer and Krueger (2016) established that data-driven, digitally dispatched platforms outperform manual radio-dispatch systems in vehicle utilization, service quality, and accountability — principles that Pasakja directly applies. Iliopoulou and Kepaptsoglou (2019) emphasize the role of Intelligent Transportation Systems in improving vehicle assignment, scheduling, and routing using real-time data. Similarly, Barrera Hernandez et al. (2025) highlight that adaptive dispatching and smart scheduling reduce delays and improve service response. In addition, Adekola et al. (2021) confirm that web-based booking systems reduce waiting time and remove the need for physical booking locations, while AbdelAziz et al. (2019) show that GPS tracking improves route planning, transparency, and reliability. Estrada-Esquivel et al. (2022) also stress the importance of web-based information systems for real-time updates and effective communication.

Altogether, these studies indicate that combining online booking, intelligent dispatching, GPS tracking, and real-time information systems leads to a more efficient and user-centered transportation service. Pasakja builds on these concepts to improve community-based transport services. The studies of Ulay et al. (2025) and Pizarro, Gumabay, and Gumarang (2025) are the most closely related to Pasakja due to their shared Philippine context and focus on community-level tricycle and ride-hailing services.

## CHAPTER 3

## TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

This chapter presents the technologies, frameworks, and tools used in the development of Pasakja: A Web-based Community Transportation Booking & Dispatching System. Each technology was selected to support the system's goals of reliability, scalability, security, and ease of use.

### Frontend Technologies

#### Next.js (App Router)

Next.js is a React-based framework for building full-stack web applications. The App Router architecture provides file-based routing, server components, and optimized performance through server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation. Next.js was selected for Pasakja because it supports both server-rendered dynamic pages and API routes within a single codebase, making it well-suited for a multi-role platform that requires role-based navigation, real-time data, and secure API handling.

#### TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking to the development process. It improves code quality, reduces runtime errors, and enhances developer productivity through better IDE tooling and refactoring capabilities. TypeScript is used throughout the Pasakja codebase to ensure that data models — such as bookings, drivers, and passengers — are consistently handled with type safety across all components and API routes.

#### Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid, responsive user interface development. It is used alongside shadcn/ui, a collection of accessible and reusable components built on Radix UI primitives. Components such as Card, Button, Input, Table, Dialog, Badge, and Select are used across the Pasakja interface to provide a consistent, professional, and accessible experience for all user roles — passengers, drivers, and administrators.

### Backend and Database

#### Node.js

Node.js is the JavaScript runtime that powers the Next.js server layer. It enables server-side execution of business logic, booking operations, API route handling, and database interactions. Node.js supports non-blocking I/O operations, making it suitable for handling concurrent booking requests from multiple users simultaneously.

#### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database management system. It supports ACID transactions, foreign key constraints, and complex relational queries. PostgreSQL was chosen for Pasakja because the system's data model — which includes interconnected entities such as users, bookings, trips, drivers, passengers, earnings, and zones — requires a reliable relational database that enforces data integrity and supports complex reporting queries.

#### Prisma ORM

Prisma is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a type-safe database client, declarative schema definitions, and migration support. In Pasakja, Prisma manages all database operations, from passenger registration and booking creation to driver availability updates and earning records. Prisma's type-safe client ensures that database queries are consistent with the defined schema, reducing the risk of runtime data errors.

### Authentication and Security

#### NextAuth (Credentials Provider)

NextAuth provides authentication for Next.js applications using a Credentials provider for username and password login. JWT-based sessions store the authenticated user's identity and role without requiring a database query on every request. NextAuth is integrated with role-aware redirection so that passengers, drivers, and administrators are each directed to their respective dashboards upon login. All non-public routes are protected by middleware that verifies the session before rendering.

#### Secure Password Hashing

User passwords in Pasakja are hashed using a secure one-way hashing algorithm before being stored in the database. Plain-text passwords are never persisted. This ensures that even in the event of unauthorized database access, user credentials remain protected.

#### Zod Validation

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library used to validate all API inputs and form submissions in Pasakja. By defining strict validation schemas for booking requests, user registration, driver profiles, and fare calculations, the system prevents invalid or malicious data from entering the database and ensures consistent data integrity across all operations.

### Media and Payment Integration

#### Cloudinary

Cloudinary is a cloud-based media management platform used in Pasakja for storing and serving driver and passenger profile images. When a user uploads a profile photo, it is sent to Cloudinary's API, which returns a secure URL that is stored in the database. This approach removes the need to store image files locally on the server and provides reliable, globally distributed image delivery.

#### PayMongo

PayMongo is a Philippine payment gateway that enables online payments for local businesses and applications. Pasakja integrates PayMongo to support GCash and card-based payments for ride bookings. The integration uses PayMongo's Payment Intent API to initiate and confirm transactions. During this study, the system operates using a PayMongo test account; production payment processing requires a verified merchant account and is identified as a future implementation step.

### Geolocation and GPS

#### Browser Geolocation API

The Browser Geolocation API is a standard web interface that allows web applications to request the user's current geographic coordinates from their device. Pasakja uses this API to capture the passenger's pickup location and the driver's current position, enabling GPS-based ride booking and location-aware dispatching. All location data is stored in the database as latitude and longitude coordinates and is used for fare computation and trip navigation.

- **Passenger, Driver, Admin** — role-specific profile data
- **Booking** — ride request with pickup/dropoff, status, fare, and payment info
- **Trip** — active trip record linked to a completed booking
- **Rating** — post-trip rating by passenger for driver
- **Earning** — driver earning record per completed trip
- **Zone, Fare** — geographic zones and associated fare rates
- **Notification** — system messages per user
- **SosAlert** — emergency alert submitted by passenger

This model supports booking lifecycle management, financial tracking, service quality scoring, administrative monitoring, and emergency handling.

### 4.7 Ethical and Security Considerations

The system adopts role-based authentication, controlled access to dashboards, and secure password hashing. Operational records are stored for transparency and accountability. Data privacy and minimal exposure of user details are considered in route-level and module-level design. The system complies with the principle of least privilege — each user role can only access the data and functions relevant to their role.

## CHAPTER 6

## SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 6.1 Summary

Pasakja was designed and implemented as a web-based community transportation booking and dispatching platform for Socorro, Surigao del Norte. The developed system operationalizes core transportation management functions for three distinct user roles — passengers, drivers, and administrators — using a centralized, role-based web architecture. The system addresses common community transportation problems including inefficient manual booking, unclear fare structures, unorganized dispatching, and lack of real-time transparency.

The system was developed using a modern full-stack technology stack comprising Next.js App Router, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, NextAuth, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Additional integrations include Cloudinary for profile image management, PayMongo for online payment processing, and the Browser Geolocation API for GPS-based location services.

### 6.2 Conclusions

Based on the implemented modules and evaluated workflows, the study concludes that:

1. A web-based platform can effectively digitize local ride booking and dispatching processes, eliminating the need for manual, in-person coordination between passengers and drivers.
2. Role-specific modules for passengers, drivers, and administrators improve coordination, reduce confusion, and ensure that each user type has access to the tools and information most relevant to their needs.
3. Centralized booking records, trip status tracking, and administrative reports improve operational transparency and support data-driven decision-making.
4. Safety and accountability are strengthened through driver verification workflows, trip history records, mutual rating systems, and SOS emergency alert functionality.
5. GPS-based location services, automated fare computation, and cashless payment integration improve the overall ride experience and bring community transportation in line with the standards set by nationally recognized platforms such as Grab, Joyride, and Angkas.
